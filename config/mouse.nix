          - BRCorner: The bottom-right edge of the window's border.
          - Client: The client area of a window, inside its decorations. Events bound to Client are also passed to applications.
          - Frame: Any part of a window, but events bound to Frame are not passed through to the application.

      description = "Load default mousebinds. This is an addition to the openbox specification and provides a way to keep
        config files simpler whilst allowing user specific binds. Note that if no rc.xml is found, or if no <mouse><mousebind>
        entries exist, the same default mousebinds will be loaded even if the <default /> element is not provided.";
