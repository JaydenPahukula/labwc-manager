        Define a key binding in the format modifier-key, where supported modifiers are:
          - S (shift)
          - C (control)
          - A or Mod1 (alt)
          - H or Mod3 (hyper)
          - W or Mod4 (super / logo)
          - M or Mod5 (meta)
        Multiple modifiers can be combined like A-S-f for Alt-Shift-f. The key itself can be any unicode character or a
        keyname like Return.
        
        Unlike Openbox, multiple space-separated key combinations and key-chains are not supported. The application "wev"
        (wayland event viewer) is packaged in a lot of distributions and can be used to view all available keynames.

        layoutDependent [yes|no] Make this specific keybind depend on the currently active keyboard layout. If enabled,
        a keybind using a key which does not exist in the currently active layout will not be executed. The physical key
        to trigger a keybind may also change along with the active layout. If set to "no" (or is absent) the keybind will
        be layout agnostic. Default is no.

        Note: conditional actions are not yet supported.

        Load the default keybinds listed below. This is an addition to the openbox specification and provides a way to
        keep config files simpler whilst allowing your specific keybinds. Note that if no rc.xml is found, or if no
        <keyboard><keybind> entries exist, the same default keybinds will be loaded even if the <default /> element is
        not provided.

        A-Tab - next window
        W-Return - alacritty
        A-F3 - run bemenu
        A-F4 - close window
        W-a - toggle maximize
        A-<arrow> - move window to edge
        W-<arrow> - resize window to fill half the output

        Audio and MonBrightness keys are also bound to amixer and brightnessctl, respectively.
